    &emsp;
    Defense Dude is by far the most popular player. His character is very user friendly. His boxing gloves add a punch (get it) and his speed makes him good at creating combos and provides him with a strong offensive game.
    <br>&emsp;
    Use Defense Dude's Up-A attack at close range to throw your opponent upward. Juggle your opponent in the air (works best against fast-falling characters) and finish it off with his Up-B uppercut to send them flying. Follow up quickly with Down-A moves in the air for spikes and edge-guarding techniques.
    <br>&emsp;
    Defense Dude's recovery isn't the best but using Side-B and Up-B in combination is your best bet of making it back to stage. If possible approach the stage from above with a Neutral-Air attack in motion to trade blows with any ledge-guarding opponent. Don't forget to use your special to KO all opponents!</p>
