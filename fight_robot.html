   <p id="about">&emsp;
    Fight Robot is an effective long-range attacket because of his wide selection of projectiles. He is slow moving, but his up close attacks hit hard; this  paired with his speed and suprisingly good air dexterity make him effective at spiking opponents trying to recover to the ledge. He is also a very good character for racking up damage on opponents, to easily send them fling, and forcing recovery situations.
    <br>&emsp;    
    Because Robot is decently heavy and floaty, he has good movement in the air, but is a large target. Robot's projectiles aren't spammy like other characters, but rather take time to recharge. This is made up for in the strength and knockback of each of these projectiles. His reflector arms are good for dealing with projectiles from opponents. Be careful while in the air against enemies like Sword-King with strong Up-A attacks; because he is floaty, Attack Robot can be KOd easily when brought too high near the stage ceiling.  He excels in stages like The Treehouse, where vertical recovery is extremely essential.
