   <p id="about"> &emsp;
    Jungle Ape is an interesting character in his unique character-switch ability. His little version is quick and agile, while his big version is a bruiser type of whose range up close provides for great grab potential. Little Apes monkey-flips lead into grabs as well.
    <br> &emsp;  
    Big Ape has very powerful moves, all with potential KO power, especially when opponents approach higher percentage.  Both versions of Jungle Ape are quite agile.  Big Ape is a larger target that is easy to hit by opponents with lots of ranged attacks. However, Big Ape using super armor with attacks allows him to avoid flinching or tripping from these projectiles.
    <br> &emsp; 
    Both version of Ape have strong edge-guarding game both with strong options for spiking opponent recoveries off-stage. Big Ape can capitalize well on this attribute because his moves have high damage and knockback. His throws also send opponents flying long distances.
    <br> &emsp;   
    Little Ape has a banana peel he can use to trip enemies, allowing for safe approaches and punishes. This combos great with up strong attack against oppoenents at high percentages.</p>
