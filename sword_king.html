   <p id="about"> &emsp;
    Sword King is a strong, solid, and balanced character, yet with useful projectiles which promote his strong zoning game. He is effective at play both offensively and defensively. Using his long sword and swirling Up-B, he is able to manage the immediate space around him very effecively. His shield out of shield is also very useful because it can block tons of projectiles.
<br> &emsp;
    His bow and boomerang have decent to spectacular range depending on the amount of time spent charging the attack. They can be useful in edgeguarding - even being used from across the stage - and breaking enemy combos. Sword King is a great team player in doubles, with strong moves to protect teammates and ranged attacks to protect their teamates from edgeguarding or combos by opponents.
<br> &emsp;
    His Up-B Spin Attack, and has a decent recovery range. It can KO opponents midair at about 120% or higher damage. On the ground, it is a powerful attack that will deal a good amount of damage to opponents and launch them a good distance as well. This attack is great for spacing opponents and sending them far distances when the approach too close.</p>
