    Attack Puff is a character that is good at 'Bait & Punish' strategy. Because he is practically just a balloon, he is very small and light, and has slow horizontal movement on ground and in the air. His recovery is excellent, but don't recover without snagging the stage-edge from below because it is easy to punish his floating recovery. Although he is a slow mover, his attacks and grab are some of the fastest in the game and is good at catching opponents out of shield and after mistakes with dodges.
    <br>&emsp;
    One of the greatest assets to Attack Puff is the versatility of his moveset, his punches poke fast and his feet have range comparable to otheer characters swords and sweeping attacks.
    <br>&emsp;
    His ground game is excellent with jabs that can be cancelled into a grab or Up-A. Attack Puff's jab is fast and can rack up damage on an opponent effectively; it has a strong strong attack capable of killing most characters at high percentages. Up-A on the ground is one of Puff's best combo starters; it combos into itself/ up strong attack/ forward strong attack/ forward-A/ back aerial/ up aerial/ neutral aerial/ forward aerial/ down strong attack/ and Up-B. Dash attack is a poor option for Puff because it has a lot of lag time that allows opponents an easy punish. Use quick attacks to rack up enemy damage, and use back-air or strong attack to KO.</p>
